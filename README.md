# Inventory
 We intend to develop a small application to manage an inventory of products from a store. The application initially reads product information from a file, to be indicated by the user. The application must allow the user to register new products, remove products from inventory, change quantities and prices of each product, list the complete inventory and calculate your value based on the price of each product. Additionally, the program must allow listing the inventory in an orderly manner, as well as listing out-of-stock products. Each product is identified by its name, being registered in the application with a certain price and quantity.
